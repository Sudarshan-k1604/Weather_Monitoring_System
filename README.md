# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring

## Overview

The **Real-Time Data Processing System** is a dynamic application designed to continuously monitor and analyze weather conditions across major Indian metros. It utilizes the **OpenWeatherMap API** to retrieve real-time weather data, which is processed and summarized using aggregates and rollups. The system aims to provide insights into weather trends and alert users when certain weather thresholds are met.

## Key Features

- **Weather Data Retrieval**: Fetch weather data every 5 minutes for specified cities.
- **Temperature Conversion**: Convert temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius based on user preferences.
- **Daily Weather Summary**: Roll up data to provide daily summaries, including average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.
- **Alerting Mechanism**: Trigger alerts based on user-configurable thresholds for weather conditions.
- **Visualizations**: Present data trends and alerts through charts and summaries.

## Objective

- Develop a system to monitor weather conditions.
- Provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates.
- Utilize data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Data Source

- Continuously retrieve weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
- Focus on the following parameters:
  - `main`: Weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear)
  - `temp`: Current temperature in Celsius
  - `feels_like`: Perceived temperature in Celsius
  - `dt`: Time of data update (Unix timestamp)

## Processing and Analysis

1. **API Calls**: Call the OpenWeatherMap API every 5 minutes for weather data in major Indian metros:
   - Cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad
2. **Weather Update Processing**:
   - Convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.

## Rollups and Aggregates

### Daily Weather Summary
- Roll up data for each day and calculate:
  - Average temperature
  - Maximum temperature
  - Minimum temperature
  - Dominant weather condition
<img src="" alt="">
### Alerting Thresholds
- Define user-configurable thresholds for temperature/weather conditions.
- Track weather data continuously and compare it with thresholds.
- Trigger alerts if thresholds are breached (console notifications or email).

## Implement Visualizations
- Display daily summaries, historical trends, and alerts.

## Test Cases

1. **System Setup**:
   - Verify successful connection to the OpenWeatherMap API.
   
2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Simulate API calls and ensure correct data retrieval and parsing.

3. **Temperature Conversion**:
   - Test conversion of temperatures based on user preferences.

4. **Daily Weather Summary**:
   - Simulate multiple weather updates and verify summary calculations.

5. **Alerting Thresholds**:
   - Define thresholds and simulate weather data exceeding those thresholds.

## Bonus Features
- Support additional weather parameters (e.g., humidity, wind speed) in rollups/aggregates.
- Retrieve weather forecasts and generate summaries based on predicted conditions.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality and correctness of the system.
- Accuracy in data parsing, conversion, and aggregate calculations.
- Efficiency of data retrieval and processing intervals.
- Completeness of test cases for various scenarios.
- Clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
- Bonus features implementation.


## Installation and Setup

-1 **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather-monitoring-system
   ```

 -2 **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

 -3 based on requirement - **Set up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```env
   OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

-4 **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

-5 **Access the Application**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
